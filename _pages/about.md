Short Bio
------

I am a postdoctoral researcher at [School of Data Science, Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shen Zhen)](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn) under the under the supervision of Professor [C. F. Jeff Wu](https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/jeffwu) and Professor [Jianhua Huang](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/470). 

Before that, I received my Ph.D. degree in Statistics from [Institute of Statistics and Big Data, Renmin University of China](http://isbd.ruc.edu.cn) in 2024, where I was fortunate to be jointly advised by Professor [Kejun He](http://isbd.ruc.edu.cn/sztd/c649d51f7a9d4557b25db81b705037e1.htm) and Professor [Xianyan Zhang](https://zhangxiany-tamu.github.io/) at Texas A&M University.

My research interests focus on multiple testing, feature selection, network data analysis, high-dimensional statistics, bioinformatics, and Mendelian randomization. I am also interested in blackbox optimization and uncertainty quantification. The motivation behind my work lies in both biology and industry, where statistical methods can provide valuable insights for large-scale biological data analysis and inform decision making in industrial settings.
