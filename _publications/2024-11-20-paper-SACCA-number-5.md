permalink: /publication/2024-11-20-paper-SACCA-number-5
excerpt: 'This paper proposes a new sCCA framework for integrating microbiome data with other high-dimensional omics data, accounting for the compositional nature of microbiome sequencing data. It also allows integrating prior structure information such as the grouping structure among bacterial taxa by imposing a “soft” constraint on the coefficients through varying penalization strength. '
